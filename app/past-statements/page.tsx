        'TPUSA at UC San Diego is deeply concerned by the recent revocation of visas for 36 legal International students without due process or clear explanationâ€”an action we find highly alarming. We believe in the United States as a nation that welcomes good people from around the world and upholds the God-given right of every individual to express themselves freely.',
        'The U.S. government should follow its own regulations and apply consistent standards of transparency and due process, even when foreign nationals are involved. We urge the University and all levels of government to support affected students, calling for full transparency and protection of their legal rights.',
        'While national security and immigration enforcement are incredibly important and vital to our country, those efforts must be thoughtfully directed. Targeting legal immigrants and valid visa holders undermines trust in our institutions and distracts from addressing real challenges posed by unlawful entry and systemic issues.'
